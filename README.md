#### Fig. 1 Dashboard

The table is divided into three sections:
1. Number of cases by month + impact group of histograms denoted by the $${\color{yellow}yellow}$$ rectangle on the left
2. Cases by impact + status histogram separated with a $${\color{red}red}$$ border in the upper right
3. Open cases | breakdown table surrounded by a $${\color{green}green}$$ rectangle on the lower right

In short - sections $${\color{yellow}1}$$, $${\color{red}2}$$ and $${\color{green}3}$$ color coded for convenience.

|17|Check if status open/closed is working|In **section 2**, the **Cases by impact + status** histogram click on either of the rectangles on the left side bellow the **Status: Open\|Closed** label. Press again to revert choice. |The histogram and numbers should change to reflect the choice.|The histogram and numbers did change to reflect the choice. |Passes.|
|18|Check by type of impact|In **section 2**, the **Cases by impact + status** histogram click on any of the individual type of impact, for exanoke **Medium**.|The histogram should change to diplay only the chosen type.|The histogram changes accordingly.|Passes.|
|19|Testing connections between **sections 2** and **3**| Like in the previous case (18) choose a type of impact and see if the table changes to reflect the choice |Table displays just the cases with the chosen type of impact.|Table changes as expected.|Passes.|
|20|Testing connections between **sections 2** and **3** the sequel|In **section 2**, the **Cases by impact + status** histogram click on any of the individual rectangle representing a month and an impact type|The **Open cases** table should isolate just the chosen impact type cases submitted in the appropriate time period|The table does not change.| Fails.|

## Bugs and glitches

|No.|Text|Comment|
|---|---|---|
|1|In **section 3** table **Open cases** pressing either the **-** in the numbers field next to the **Sort by** dropdown menu allows changing the **Cases opened over _ days** to be negative, for example "Cases opened over -3 days"|See fig. 4|
|2|The main histogram in **section 2** does not present all cases and shows wrong numbers. Case in point severe impact cases (0) and high impact (shows 4 instead of 3)in Nov. 2021 |See fig. 4|
|3|Not much of a bug so much as a discrepancy between the sections. In the **Cases by impact + status** histogram (**section 2**) Impact of the cases isordered in reverse compared to the other parts. For uniformity's sake. ||
|4|In **section 3** table **Open cases** table the case type column (Â·) should be renamed for more legibility.||
|5|In **section 3** table **Open cases** table the days opened column header should not be blank.||
|6|In **section 3** table **Open cases** table the case impact column header should not be blank.||
|7|When toggling closed cases in **section 2** and selecting a single type of impact, the same type is isolated in **section 3** table **Open cases**, under those conditions it shouldn't.
|8|The **Open cases** table doesn't reflect the highlighted and chosen part of the **Cases by impact + status** histogram as per test 20.
