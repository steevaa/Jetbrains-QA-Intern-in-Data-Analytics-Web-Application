Bugs
|No.| Test | Steps | Expected result | Actual result | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|In section 3 table **Open cases** changing the **Cases opened over _ days** by pressing either the **+** or **-** in the numbers field next to the **Sort by** dropdown menu does not limit the cases shown. |||||||
|2|In section 3 table **Open cases** pressing either the **-** in the numbers field next to the **Sort by** dropdown menu allows changing the **Cases opened over _ days** to be negative, for example "Cases opened over -3 days"|
|3|The main histogram in section 2 does not present all cases and shows wrong numbers. Case in point severe impact cases (0) and high impact (shows 4 instead of 3)in Nov. 2021 |
|4|Not much of a bug so much as a discrepancy between the sections. In the **Cases by impact + status** histogram (section 2) Impact of the cases isordered in reverse compared to the other parts. For uniformity's sake 
|5|In section 3 table **Open cases** table the case type column (Â·) should be renamed for more legibility.
|6||In section 3 table **Open cases** table the days opened column header should not be blank.
|7||In section 3 table **Open cases** table the case impact column header should not be blank
